# Graber - Ruby

Graber is a framework for Graphql automation using Cucumber in Ruby language. Graphql automation can be done just by defining the query, query variable and other requirements from cucumber's feature file itself. All the core logics are covered in step definition file. Graber also includes snap feature which helps to replace the exisiting JSON's (which is used to compare with the response JSON) with the new response JSON's. This helps greatly in data centric applications.
